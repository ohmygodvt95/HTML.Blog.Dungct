# To be updated

# iCompanion (2011-2013)
* This project aims at developing a intelligent travel guide application running on smartphone by applying Semantic Web technologies. The research focuses on the semantic search and recommendation of travel places, local services and user-relevant itinerary.

# STORES

* STORES is Enterprise knowlege management platform developped around semantic technology. Relying on an ontology that plays role of sharing conceptualization primitive vocabulary for providing ingredient to represent the enterprise structure as well as specialized knowledge - the expertise of enterprise can be acquired - refined and imported to this system as semantic annotations. Then they can be accessed easily through a semantic query interface. MISEPT is a web based system contains many tools supporting all these task thanks to various component such as ontology management- knowledge management- semantic search- SVG visualization,..
* This system is independent of application domains and can be deployed in many fields such as manufaction, heath care or security.
* Project was launched in the context of the collaboration between Department of Software Engineering with Mitani Sangyo company, Japan.

# Analyze module influences in C Source Code

* This project was also a part of the collaboration work between Department of Software Engineering with Panasonic R&D. We study the influences of a module to the other in software project written in C language. An automated code analyzer named Kagyu was build in 6 months.

# Embedded software development using JNI

* Started from Mars 2007 in the context of the collaboration research between Department of Software Engineering with Panasonic Singapore Lab, this work aims to develop a practical guideline to implement embedded system software in Java through the two case study:
    * Implementation of a control program for Logitech Quick Cam Orbit MP.The program is mainly written in Java with JNI technology to access drivers of the device.
    * Translation of open source code movie player written in C/C++ to Java in two versions:naive and the ones implemented on the RTSJ.
